        "explanation": " An image can be expressed as the multiplication of illumination and reflectance component i.e. f(x, y) = i(x, y) * r(x, y). The equation can't be used directly to operate separately on the frequency component of illumination and reflectance because the Fourier transform of the product of two function is not separable. So, the logarithmic operation is used. I{z(x,y)}=I{ln(f(x,y)) }=I{ln(i(x,y)) }+I{ln(r(x,y))}.",
