        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "As there are n possible edges to be removed from G and m edges to be removed from G and the rest from a spanning tree so the number of spanning tree in the new graph is m*n."

            "d) O(logn)"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The existence of a cycle in directed and undirected graphs can be determined by depth-first search (DFS) of the graph finds an edge that points to an ancestor of the current vertex. In an undirected graph, finding any already visited vertex will indicate a back edge. All the back edges which DFS skips over are part of cycles. In the case of undirected graphs, only O(n) time is required to find a cycle in an n-vertex graph, since at most n \u2212 1 edges can be tree edges."

        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The term cycle refers to an element of the cycle space of a graph. There are many cycle spaces. The most common is the binary cycle space, which contains the edge sets that have even degrees at every vertex and it forms a vector space over the two-element field."

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "A simple circuit in a graph G that passes through every vertex exactly once is called a Hamiltonian circuit. If there is a vertex of degree one in a graph then it is impossible for it to have a Hamiltonian circuit. If G is a simple graph with n-vertices and n>=3 such that the degree of every vertex in G is at least n/2, then G has a Hamiltonian circuit."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "In a complete graph of order n, there are n*(n-1) number of edges and degree of each vertex is (n-1). Hence, for a graph of order 9 there should be 36 edges in total."

        "answer": "d",

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "An undirected graph has Eulerian Path if the following two conditions are true: -a) All vertices with a non-zero degree are connected. A graph of vertices with zero degrees don\u2019t belong to Eulerian Cycle or Path, b) If two vertices have odd degree and all other vertices have even degree. Thus, the time to find whether a graph has a Eulerian path or not is O(V+E) with V vertices and E edges."

        "answer": "d",
