        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "In transposition cipher and mono alphabetic cipher the number of letters in the plain text and ciphered text remain same. But in poly alphabetic cipher the number of letters change. So here as vigenere cipher is the only poly alphabetic cipher so it will be the answer."
