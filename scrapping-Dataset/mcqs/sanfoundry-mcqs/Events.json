        "explanation": "In MySQL, in order to check the status of the event scheduler at runtime, the statement: SHOW VARIABLES LIKE \u2018event_scheduler\u2019; is used. The event_scheduler is a system variable."

        "explanation": "In MySQL, if the event_scheduler is set to \u2018DISABLED\u2019 at startup, its status cannot be changed but can be checked at runtime. The events can be created but they will not execute."

        "answer": "d",
