        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Maximum number of edges occur in a complete bipartite graph when every vertex has an edge to every opposite vertex in the graph. Number of edges in a complete bipartite graph is a*b, where a and b are no. of vertices on each side. This quantity is maximum when a = b i.e. when there are 7 vertices on each side. So answer is 7 * 7 = 49."

In case of the intersection of n line segments or other simple shapes in the Euclidean graph, it is possible to test whether the graph is bipartite and it will return either a two-coloring or an odd cycle in time O(nlogn), even though the graph itself has up to O(n"

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "All types of cyclic graphs are examples of cyclic graphs. A cyclic graph is considered bipartite if all the cycles involved are of even length. Bipartite graphs are widely used in modern coding theory apart from being used in modeling relationships."
