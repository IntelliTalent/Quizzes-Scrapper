            "a) dictionary ordering of elements",

            "d) to sort according to value of last element"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Lexicographical order is also known as dictionary order. It is a generalized method of the way words are alphabetically ordered in a dictionary."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "No.of combinations of r elements for an array of size n will be given by the formula nCr. So for the given problem, we have 3C2=3."

        "answer": "c",

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "In the code we start from first index (index = 0) in array aux and one by one fix elements at this index and recur for remaining indexes. Finally, when index becomes equal to r we print the combination."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "In this method we consider each method one by one and recur for two cases.In first case we include that element in our array and in second case we don\u2019t .When the number of elements in the array aux[] becomes equal to r then we print that combination."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Explanation:The given code prints combination of the elements of a given array.But the difference here is that this code also handles duplicate elements due to which we get only 2 combinations instead of 3."
