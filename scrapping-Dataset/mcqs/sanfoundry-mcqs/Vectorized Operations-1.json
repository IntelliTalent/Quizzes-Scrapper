            "a) Very less operations in R are vectorized",
            "b) Vectorization allows you to write code that is efficient, concise, and easier to read than in non-vectorized languages",
            "c) vectorized means that operations occur in parallel in certain R objects",
            "d) Matrix operations are also vectorized"
