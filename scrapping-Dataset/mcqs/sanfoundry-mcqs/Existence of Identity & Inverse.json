        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "There can be only one identity element in a group and each element in a group has exactly one inverse element. Hence, two important consequences of the group axioms are the uniqueness of the identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements."

        "explanation": "1 is the multiplicative identity of natural numbers as a\u22c51=a=1\u22c5a \u2200a\u2208N. Thus, 1 is the identity of multiplication for the set of integers(Z), set of rational numbers(Q), and set of real numbers(R)."

        "explanation": "By the definition of all elements of a group have an inverse. For an element, a in a group G, an inverse of a is an element b such that ab=e, where e is the identity in the group. The inverse of an element is unique and usually denoted as -a."
