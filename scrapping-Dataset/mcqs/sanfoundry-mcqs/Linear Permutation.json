        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "Let\u2019s consider the given string is CLEAN, so set of string of length 1 = {C,L,E,A,N} ; cardinality of set = 5 set of string of length 2 = {CL,EE,EA,NN}, set of string of length 3 = {CLE,LEE,EAN}, set of strings of length 4 = {CLEN,LEAN}, set of strings of length 5 = {CLEAN} and set of string of length 0 = {} and we cannot have any substring of length 6 as given string has only 5 length. So total no of substrings are possible = 0 length substring + 1 length substring + 2 length substrings +3 length substrings + 4 length substrings + 5 length substrings = 1 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 16 means for 1 length string to n length substrings it will sum of the n natural no from 1 to n."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "The word \u2018SWIMMING contains 8 letters. Of which, I occurs twice and M occurs twice. Therefore, the number of words formed by this word = \\(\\frac{8!}{2!*2!}\\) = 10080. In order to find the number of permutations that can be formed where the two vowels I and I come together,  we group the letters that should come together and consider that group as one letter. So, the letters are S, W, M, M, N, G, (I, I). So, the number of letters are 7 the number of ways in which 7 letters can be arranged is 7! = 5040. In I and I, the number of ways in which I and I can be arranged is 2!. Hence, the total number of ways in which the letters of the \u2018SWIMMING\u2019 can be arranged such that vowels are always together are \\(\\frac{7!}{2!*2!}\\) = 5040 ways. The number of words in which the vowels do not come together is = (10080 \u2013 5040) = 5040."
