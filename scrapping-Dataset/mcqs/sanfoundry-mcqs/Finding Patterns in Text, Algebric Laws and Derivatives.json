        "explanation": "0101 or 1010 the strings with minimum length on {0,1}* which does not belong to the language of the given regular expression.Other strings like 111, 000, 1101, etc are accepted by the language ."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "What we observe from the question is that, it includes e and 11 and any number of 1\u2019s then. Therefore, its simplifies when we write the same reg. Expression as (11+111)*."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "It is not required to automate the question if asked theoretically.The number of zeroes fixed is 2. Therefore, we can represent the regular expression as 1*01*01*."

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "There are two approaches to infer that certain string are in the language of a certain variable. The most conventional way is to use the rules from body to head, recursive inference. The second approach is expanding the starting variable using one of its productions whose head is tart symbol and derive a string consisting entirely of terminals(head to body or derivations)."
