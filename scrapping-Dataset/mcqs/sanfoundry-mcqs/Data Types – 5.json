        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "A vector is the most common and basic data structure in R. Technically, vectors can be one of two types of atomic vectors and lists. Although vector most commonly refers to the atomic types."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Lists are sometimes called generic vectors because the elements of a list can be of any type of R object, even lists containing further lists. This property makes them fundamentally different from other atomic vectors. Create lists using list() and coerce other objects using as.list()."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "A data frame is a very important data type in R. It\u2019s pretty much the de facto data structure for most tabular data and what we use for statistics. A data frame was a special type of list in which every element of the list has the same length."
