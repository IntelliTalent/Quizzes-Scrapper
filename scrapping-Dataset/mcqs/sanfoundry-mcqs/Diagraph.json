        "explanation": "A directed graph or digraph is an ordered pair D<A, R> where A(is a set of nodes of D) is a set and R(the elements of R are the arcs of D) is a binary relation on A. The relation R is called the incidence relation on D. Now, a digraph is a subgraph of D if i)A\u2019 \u2282 A and ii)R\u2019 = R \u2229 (A\u2019 x A\u2019). If D\u2019  D, D\u2019 is a proper subgraph of D."

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "If a graph say G = <V, E> has no parallel or multiple edges and no self loops contained in it is called a simple graph. An undirected graph may have multiple edges and self-loops."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Number of edges incident on a graph is known as degree of a vertex. Sum of degrees of each vertex is called total degree of the graph. Total degree = 2 * number of vertices. So, if there are 24 vertices then total degree is 24."
