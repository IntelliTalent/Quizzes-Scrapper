        "options": [],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "In MySQL, the administrators have more privileges since they have more control of the MySQL server or the machine on which it runs. Accessing data in memory is faster than from disk."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "In MySQL, when the server opens table files it keeps them open to minimize the number of file-opening operations. It maintains information about open files in the table cache."

        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "When the server accesses various tables, the table cache fills up. The server closes the tables that have not been used recently in order to make room for opening the new tables."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The larger values allow MySQL to hold more index blocks in memory at once. This increases the chances of finding key values in memory without having to read a new block from disk."

        "explanation": "In MySQL, in order to determine whether a server supports the query cache or not, the value of the \u2018have_query_cache\u2019 system variable is checked. It returns \u2018YES\u2019 if support is available."
