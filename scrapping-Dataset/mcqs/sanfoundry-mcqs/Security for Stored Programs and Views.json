            "c) View",
            "d) Table"
        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "When a stored program is created, an object is created that is to be executed later. This also the case when a view is defined: It sets up a SELECT statement intended for later invocation."

        "question": "When the security context enables carefully written stored programs to be set up that provide controlled access to tables for users, it is called __________",
        "options": [
            "a) good",
            "b) bad",
            "c) illegal",
            "d) fare"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The security context is good if it enables carefully written stored programs to be set up that provide controlled access to tables for users who are not able to access them directly."

        "question": "When a user creates a stored program that accesses sensitive data but forgets that other people who can invoke the object have the same access, the security context is __________",
        "options": [
            "a) good",
            "b) bad",
            "c) illegal",
            "d) fare"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The security context is bad if a user creates a stored program that accesses sensitive data but forgets that other people who can invoke the object have the same access to that data as its definer."

            "a) True",
            "b) False"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The triggers and events are invoked automatically by the server, so the concept of invoking user is not applied. Thus, they have no SQL SECURITY characteristic and always execute with definer privileges."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "In MySQL, a stored procedure is invoked using the CALL statement. A stored procedure does not have a return value but can modify its parameters. It also returns some result sets."

            "c) TOP",
            "d) SUPERIOR"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "In order to create or alter a stored function, the SUPER privilege should be given in addition to the CREATE ROUTINE privilege that is normally required. Depending on the DEFINER value in the function definition SUPER might be required."
