        "explanation": "Factors are used to represent categorical data and can unordered and ordered. One can think of a factor as an integer vector where each integer has a label. Factors are important in statistical modelling and are treated specially by modelling functions like lm() and glm()."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Functions are often used to encapsulate a sequence of expressions that need to be executed numerous times, perhaps under slightly different conditions. Functions are also often written when code must be shared with others."
