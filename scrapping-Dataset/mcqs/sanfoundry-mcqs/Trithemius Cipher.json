        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Trithemius cipher is a substitution cipher. It falls under the category of poly alphabetic cipher as it uses multiple substitutions at different positions in order to cipher the plain text."

        ],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "If in caesar cipher we consider a shift that increases by 1 by each letter starting at 0 then it is equivalent to trithemius cipher. So trithemius cipher is a special case of caesar cipher."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Trithemius cipher is a special case of vigenere cipher. The difference is that vigenere cipher uses a different key every time but a fixed key is used by trithemius cipher."

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "Ciphers like running key cipher, vigenere cipher, trithemius cipher, etc. makes use of tabula recta. Whereas hill cipher, rail fence cipher and route cipher does not require tabula recta for encryption of plain text."

        "explanation": "Trithemius cipher is a special case of vigenere cipher and running key cipher is a variation of vigenere cipher. If one figures out that the cipher being used is trithemius then it is very easy to crack, unlike running key and vigenere ciphers as these use a secret key for encryption."
