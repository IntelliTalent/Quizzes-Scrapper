        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "In MySQL, each datatype has its own range. Data types give an idea of the kind of values and the ranges that a variable is allowed to store. The maximum non zero value for FLOAT is 3.402823466E+38."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "In MySQL, all the datatypes have their own ranges. Data types give an idea of the kind of values and the ranges that a variable is allowed to store. The maximum non zero value for DOUBLE is \u00b11.7976931348623157E+308."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "The numeric datatypes used in MySQL vary over ranges. There are a variety of INT types in the type specification. TINYINT requires 1, SMALLINT requires 2 bytes and MEDIUMINT requires 3."

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "All the numeric datatypes used in MySQL vary over the fields. However the maximum size is fixed. Unlike the other numeric types the size of the BIT datatype depends on the length of the field."

            "a) FLOAT",

            "c) DOUBLE",
            "d) BIT"
        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "The REAL datatype, by default, is for the DOUBLE type. Floating point types can be defined as UNSIGNED. This eliminates the negative end of the type ranges. MySQL has a variety of default types."

        "question": "The number of binary string types among the following is ___________",
        "options": [],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "In MySQL, the string datatypes are broadly categorised into two, namely, binary string types and non binary string types. BINARY, VARBINARY and BLOB are the binary string datatypes."

            "d) 65537"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The allowable range of M for VARCHAR(M) syntactically is 1 to 65535, but the effective number of the maximum characters is less than 65535 since MySQL has a maximum row size of 65,535 bytes."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "BLOB or TEXT columns sometimes can be indexed, depending on the storage engine. MEMORY tables do not support BLOB and TEXT indexes. The MEMORY engine does not support BLOB or TEXT."
