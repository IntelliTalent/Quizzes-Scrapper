            "b) Sapply",
            "c) Vapply",

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "If the programmers want the output to be a data frame or a vector, then sapply function is used whereas if the programmer wants the output to be a list then lapply is used. vapply allows the programmer to specific the output type."

            "d) Zapply"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "sapply() function does the same jobs as lapply() function but returns a vector. We can use a user built-in function into lapply() or sapply(). We create a function named avg to compute the average of the minimum and maximum of the vector."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Vapply is similar to sapply, but has a pre-specified type of return value, so it can be safer (and sometimes faster) to use. simplify2array() is the utility called from sapply() when simplify is not false and is similarly called from mapply()."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Vapply allows the programmer to specific the output type. The disadvantage of using vapply is that it is very  difficult to be implemented and more verbose. vapply is similar to sapply, but has a pre-specified type of return value, so it can be safer to use."
