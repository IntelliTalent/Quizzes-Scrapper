        ],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "A push down automata uses a stack to carry out its operations. They are more capable than the finite automatons but less than the turing model."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The term pushdown refers to the fact that the elements are pushed down in the stack and as per the LIFO principle, the operation is always performed on the top element of the stack."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Push and pop are the operations we perform to operate a stack. A stack follows the LIFO principle, which states its rule as: Last In First Out."
