            "a) logic minimization",

            "c) summing of parity bits",
            "d) logic gate creation"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "K-map(Maurice Karnaugh of Bell labs in 1953) is defined as a diagrammatic method for logic minimization and it is a pictorial view of truth table which shows the relationship between inputs and output. It is more efficient than Boolean algebra. K-map is a diagram made up of squares in which each square represents a minterm or maxterm of the logic function."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "A seven segment decoder is a digital circuit which is used to construct a common type of digital display device i.e., a set of LED (or LCD) segments that display numbers from 0 through 9 at the command of a four-bit code. Moreover, the behavior of the display driver IC is represented by a truth table with seven outputs."

            "a) single bit",

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "In Gray coding, the adjacent code values differ only by a single bit. If the given code-word is 01, then the previous and the next code-words are to be 11 or 00 but cannot be 10 in any case. Each cell within a K-map has a definite place-value which is obtained by using this encoding technique. The rows and the columns of the table use Gray code-labeling which in turn represents the values of the corresponding input variables and each K-map cell can be addressed using a unique Gray Code-Word."
