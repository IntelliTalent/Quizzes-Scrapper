        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "All the Strings are getting accepted except \u2018ababaabaa\u2019 as it is directed to dumping state. Dumping state also refers to the reject state of the automata."

            "d) String of letter count 11"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "As the initial state is not made an acceptance state, thus \u03b5 will not be accepted by the given DFA. For the automata to accept \u03b5 as an entity, one should make the initial state as also the final state."
