            "d) a secret code"
        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption. In cryptography, a set of defined steps are followed to generate ciphers. These are necessary to prevent data breach."

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "In poly alphabetic cipher each symbol of plain text is replaced by a different cipher text regardless of its occurrence. Out of the given options, only affine cipher is not a poly alphabetic cipher."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Mono alphabetic ciphers can be decoded by using the method frequency analysis. But in poly alphabetic cipher each symbol of plain text is replaced by a different cipher text regardless of its occurrence. This makes it very difficult to be decoded by using frequency analysis."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "In transposition cipher and mono alphabetic cipher the number of letters remains the same in ciphered and deciphered text. But in poly alphabetic cipher the number of letters are different. So here as hill cipher is the only poly alphabetic cipher so it will be the answer."
