        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a set of applications and features that allow IT professionals and others to develop, edit, administer, and interact with relational databases."

        "question": "What is an RDBMS?",
        "options": [
            "a) Database that stores data elements that are not linked",
            "b) Database that accesses data elements that are not linked",

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "A relational database is a form of database that stores and allows access to data elements that are linked. The relational model, a simple and obvious means of representing data in tables, is the foundation of relational databases."

            "d) Can\u2019t say",
            "i) All of the elements that make up a full database transaction are defined by atomicity."
        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Relational database transactions are defined by four key properties: atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (also known as ACID)."

        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "In a relational database, each table, also known as a relation, includes one or more data types in the form of columns or attributes. Each row, also known as a record or tuple, includes a single instance of data \u2014 or key \u2014 for each of the columns categories."
