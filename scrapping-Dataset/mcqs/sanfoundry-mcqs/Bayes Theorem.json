        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": " The probability that the card drawn is a queen = \\(\\frac{4}{52}\\), since there are 4 queens in a standard deck of 52 cards. If the event is \u201cthis card is a queen\u201d the prior probability P(queen) = \\(\\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\\). The posterior probability P(queen|face) can be calculated using Bayes theorem: P(king|face) = P(face|king)/P(face)*P(king). Since every queen is also a face card, P(face|queen) = 1. The probability of a face card is P(face) = (\\(\\frac{3}{13}\\)). [since there are 3 face cards in each suit (Jack, Queen, King)]. Using Bayes theorem gives P(queen|face) = \\(\\frac{13}{3}*\\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)."

By Bayes theorem the probability that a mail marked spam is really a spam = (Probability of being spam and being detected as spam)/(Probability of being detected as spam)  = (0.18 * 0.82)/(0.18 * 0.82) + (0.18 * 0.82) = 0.5 or 50%."

The probability that the first one is even is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), for the second mango, given that the first one was even, there are only 9 even numbered balls that could be drawn from a total of 17 balls, so the probability is \\(\\frac{9}{17}\\). For the third mango, since the first two are both odd, there are 8 even numbered mangoes that could be drawn from a total of 16 remaining balls and so the probability is \\(\\frac{8}{16}\\) and for fourth mango, the probability is = \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\). So the probability that all 4 mangoes are even numbered is \\(\\frac{10}{18}*\\frac{9}{17}*\\frac{8}{16}*\\frac{7}{16}\\) = 0.068 or 6.8%."
