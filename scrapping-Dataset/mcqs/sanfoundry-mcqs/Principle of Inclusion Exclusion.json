        "options": [
            "a) 39",

            "c) 47",
            "d) 53"
        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "By using the inclusion-exclusion principle: |T \u222a M| = |T| + |M| \u2013 |T \u2229 M| = (29 + 32) \u2013 (14) = 47. Thus 47 patients are diagnosed with either typhoid or malaria."

        "question": "At a software company, skilled workers have been hired for a project. Out of 75 candidates, 48 of them were software engineer; 35 of them were hardware engineer; 42 of them were network engineer; 18 of them had skills in all three jobs and all of them had skills in at least one of these jobs. How many candidates were hired who were skilled in exactly 2 jobs?",
        "options": [
            "a) 69",
            "b) 14",
            "c) 32",
            "d) 8"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Since 18 are skilled in all 3. Subtract 18 from all three to get a total with single skilled and double skilled workers including the duplicates. Software engineers = 48 \u2013 18 = 30, Hardware engineers = 35 \u2013 18 = 17, Network engineers = 42 \u2013 18 = 24 making a total of 71 and this is a total set of single and double skilled workers including duplicates. Out of 75 candidates, 18 were skilled in three areas. So, 75 \u2013 18 = 57 (actual no of workers skilled with single and both skills) Now the difference between the number without duplicates (57) and with duplicates (71), 71 \u2013 57 = 14. So, 14 are skilled in exactly two jobs."

        "question": "In a renowned software development company of 240 computer programmers 102 employees are proficient in Java, 86 in C#, 126 in Python, 41 in C# and Java, 37 in Java and Python, 23 in C# and Python, and just 10 programmers are proficient in all three languages. How many computer programmers are there those are not proficient in any of these three languages?",

            "a) 138",

            "d) 49"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Let U denote the set of all employed computer programmers and let J, C and P denote the set of programmers proficient in Java, C# and Python, respectively. So,  |U| = 240, |J| = 102, |C| = 86, |P| = 126, |J \u2229 C| = 41, |J \u2229 P| = 37, |C \u2229 P| = 23 and |J \u2229 C \u2229 P| = 10. The number of computer programmers that are not proficient in any of these three languages is said to be same as the cardinality of the complement of the set J \u222a C \u222a P. First, we have to calculate |J \u222a C \u222a P| = 102 + 86 + 126 \u2013 41 \u2013 37 \u2013 23 + 10 = 223. Now calculate |(J \u222a C \u222a P)\u2019 | = |U| \u2013 |J \u222a C \u222a P| = 240 \u2013 223 = 17. 17 programmers are not proficient in any of the three languages."

        "explanation": "There are 15 people who wish to join football, but 9 of those people also join basketball. By using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we have: 15 people joining football + 24 people joining basketball \u2013 9 people who will join both = 30 people total."

Then Since there are 13 different ranks of cards in the deck, P(M) = \\(\\frac{1}{13}\\) and since there are 4 suits in the deck, P(N) = \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). There is only one card that is both a queen and a heart, so P(M \u22c2 N) = \\(\\frac{1}{52}\\).
