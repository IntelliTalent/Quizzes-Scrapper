        "explanation": "The \u2018CREATE FUNCTION\u2019 statement is used to create a stored function in MySQL. The \u2018CREATE PROCEDURE\u2019 statement is used to create a stored procedure instead, from which values are not returned."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "When a stored function is defined with the same name as a built in function, the function name should be qualified with the database name when it is invoked. The function \u2018PI()\u2019 is built in."
