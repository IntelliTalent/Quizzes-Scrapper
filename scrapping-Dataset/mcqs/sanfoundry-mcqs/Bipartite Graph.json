        "explanation": "We can prove this by induction. By adding one edge, the degree of vertices in U is equal to 1 as well as in V. Let us assume that this is true for n-1 edges and add one more edge. Since the given edge adds exactly once to both U and V we can tell that this statement is true for all n vertices."

        "explanation": "We can prove it in this following way. Let \u20181\u2019 be a vertex in bipartite set X and let \u20182\u2019 be a vertex in the bipartite set Y. Therefore the bipartite set X contains all odd numbers and the bipartite set Y contains all even numbers. Now let us consider a graph of odd cycle (a triangle). There exists an edge from \u20181\u2019 to \u20182\u2019, \u20182\u2019 to \u20183\u2019 and \u20183\u2019 to \u20181\u2019. The latter case (\u20183\u2019 to \u20181\u2019) makes an edge to exist in a bipartite set X itself. Therefore telling us that graphs with odd cycles are not bipartite."
