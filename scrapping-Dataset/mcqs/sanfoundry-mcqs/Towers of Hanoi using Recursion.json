        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Objective of tower of hanoi problem is to move all disks to some other rod by following the following rules-1) Only one disk can be moved at a time. 2) Disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk of the stack. 3) No disk should be placed over a smaller disk."
