        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Integer partition is the way of representing an integer as sum of positive integers. Partitions differing only in their order are considered to be same."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "We need to find the combinations of positive integers which give 3 as their sum. These will be {3}, {2,1}, {1,1,1}. Thus the correct answer is 3."

            "b) false"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Partitions differing in order are considered to be same. Thus 2 1 and 1 2 are considered to be same when we generate partitions of integer 3."
