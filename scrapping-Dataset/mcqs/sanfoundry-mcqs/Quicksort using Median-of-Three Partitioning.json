        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Auxiliary space complexity of median of three quick sort is O(log n) which is used for storing call stack formed due to recursion. Note that the algorithms with space complexity as O(log n) also qualifies as in place algorithms as the value of log n is close to 1."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The average case time complexity of median of three quick sort is the same as that of a standard quick sort as randomized quick sort only helps in preventing the worst case. It is equal to O(n log n)."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Median of three quick sort like standard quick sort is also not a stable sorting algorithm. It is because the elements with the same values are not guaranteed to appear in the same relative order in the output sorted array."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Best case time complexity is given in the case when there is equal partitioning of the array about the pivot. It is given by the relation T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n which gives the result O(n log n)."
