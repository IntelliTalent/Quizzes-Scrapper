        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "A context-sensitive grammar (CSG) is a formal grammar in which the left-hand sides and right-hand sides of any production rules may be surrounded by a context of terminal and non terminal symbols. Context-sensitive grammars are more general than context-free grammars, in the sense that there are some languages that cannot be described by context-free grammars, but can be described by CSG."
