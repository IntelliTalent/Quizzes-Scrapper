        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Since there are infinitely many possible outcomes for the value of X we will take the equally likely outcomes as random points along the number line from 5 to 9. R will be closer to 5 than it is to 6 if R<5.5. We can easily see it by drawing a probability line. Here, P(R is closer to 5 than to 6) = (length of segment where 5<R<5.5)/(length of segment where (5<R<9) = 0.5/4 = 0.125 = 12.5%."

The points which are closer to the center than to the edge are those that lie within the circle of radius around the center. Hence, the area of the success outcomes is \u03c0(r/2)"

        "explanation": "In this instance, a success is a bug-free compilation, and a failure is the discovery of a bug. The programmer needs to have 0, 1 or 2 failures, so her probability of finishing the program is: P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) = (0.95)"
