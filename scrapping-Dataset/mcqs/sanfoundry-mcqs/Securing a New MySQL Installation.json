            "d) leaf"
        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "The root accounts are superuser accounts intended for administrative purposes. The root accounts have the privileges and to delete all the databases and shutting down the server."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The data directory is initialized during the installation by \u2018mysql_install_db\u2019. If MySQL is installed on Linux from RPM packages then \u2018mysql_install_db\u2019 is run automatically."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "For the \u2018REVOKE\u2019 and \u2018DROP USER\u2019 statements, the server automatically re-reads the grant tables and no FLUSH PRIVILEGES statements are needed. Hence the grant tables are re-read."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "The default case sensitivity imposes a dependency on the operating system of the machine on which the MySQL server is running. Windows does not treat database and table names as case sensitive unlike Unix."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "The stored functions and stored procedure names in MySQL are not case sensitive. Event names are also not case sensitive. Unlike the standard SQL, the trigger names in MySQL is case sensitive."

            "d) lower_case_aliases"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "In MySQL, by default the alias names are case sensitive. An alias can hence be specified in any letter case, upper, lower or mixed. If the variable \u2018lower_case_table_names\u2019 is non zero, the alias names of tables are not case sensitive."

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "The \u2018COLLATE\u2019 operator can be used to sort the string values according to a specific collation. For example, \u2018SELECT col FROM tbl ORDER BY col COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci\u2019 sorts by Swedish collation."

            "d) SHOW COLLATIONS"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "It is simple to determine the character sets and collations that are available in MySQL. \u2018SHOW CHARACTER SET\u2019 shows the character sets while \u2018SHOW COLLATION\u2019 shows the collations."
    },
    {
        "question": "The collations this statement lists are ______________",
        "options": [],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The character set \u2018utf8\u2019 is used for the Unicode character set 8. The \u2018LIKE\u2019 keyword does the job of narrowing the search space to refer to only those names that begin with \u2018utf8\u2019."
