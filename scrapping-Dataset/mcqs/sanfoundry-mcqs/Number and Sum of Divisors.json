        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The exact number of running time depends on the computational model. When analyzing arithmetic with large numbers, we usually count either bit operations or arithmetic operations of size O(logn) (where n is the input size). Now, given the factorization of a number n, then the sum of divisors can be computed in polynomial time."
