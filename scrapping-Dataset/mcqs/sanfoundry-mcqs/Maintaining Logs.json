        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The error log contains a record of server startups and shutdowns and the messages about problems or exceptional conditions. If the server fails to start this log provides the help."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The server maintains a \u2018long_query_time\u2019 system variable that defines slow queries (10 seconds by default). If a query takes more than these seconds of real time it is considered slow."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The \u2018\u2013log-bin-index\u2019 is the logging option that enables the binary log index file. \u2018\u2013log-error\u2019 enables the error log file. Similarly, \u2013log enables the general log file."
