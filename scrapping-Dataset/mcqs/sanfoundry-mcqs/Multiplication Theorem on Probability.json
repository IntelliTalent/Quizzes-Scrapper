        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "To choose any clock for the first pick, there are 10+16=26 options. For the second choice, we have 25 clocks left to choose from and so on. Thus, by the rule of product, there are 26 * 25 * 24 * 23 = 650 possible ways to choose exactly four clocks. However, we have counted every clock combination twice. Hence, the correct number of possible ways are 650/2 = 325."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Each die roll is independent, that is, if the first die roll result is 8, it will not affect the probability of the second die roll resulting in 8. The probability of rolling one die is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\). Now, P (1st roll is 8 \u2229 2nd roll is 8). By using the rule of product: \\(\\frac{1}{8} * \\frac{1}{8}\\). Hence, the probability that both die rolls are 8 is \\(\\frac{1}{64}\\)."

These events are independent, that is, the selection of the scarf does not affect the selection of the tops and so on.

After that, he can either take a bus or a train to Delhi and hence he has another 4 * 7 = 11 ways to head to Delhi(Rule of sum).
