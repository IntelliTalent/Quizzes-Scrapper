        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Since multiplication of two negative rational numbers gives a positive number. Hence, closure property is not satisfied. Singular matrices do not form a group under multiplication. Matrices have to be non-singular (determinant !=0) for the inverse to exist. Hence the set of all non-singular matrices forms a group under multiplication is a true option."

Now, we cannot concatenate any string with a given string to get empty string there is no inverse for string concatenation. Only other 3 group properties such as closure, associative and existence of identity are satisfied."
