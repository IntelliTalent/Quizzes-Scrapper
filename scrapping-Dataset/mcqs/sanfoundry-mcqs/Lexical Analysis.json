        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Reserved words are known as keywords and they are specific and reserved with its functionality to a language. Thus, getting an input with the same name by the analyzer will generate an error."

        ],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "Lexical analysis is done using few tools such as lex, flex and jflex. Jflex is a computer program that generates lexical analyzers (also known as lexers or scanners) and works apparently like lex and flex. Lex is commonly used with yacc parser generator."

        ],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "A program which performs lexical analysis is called lexer, scanner or lexer. Nowadays, lexer is combined with a parser which allows syntactic analysis."

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "Lexers and parsers are most commonly used in compilers, but it has more application elsewhere like in prettyprinters or linters(application of stylistic formatting conventions to textfiles, source code, etc.)."
