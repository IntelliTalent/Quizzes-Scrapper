        "options": [
            "a) The query scans the index and not the collection",
            "b) If overall selectivity is high, and if MongoDB must read a number of documents to return results, then some queries may perform faster without indexes",
            "c) A better strategy, depending on your queries, would be to create a compound index that includes the high-selectivity field and another field",

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "To ensure selectivity, write queries that limit the number of possible documents with the indexed field. Write queries that are appropriately selective relative to your indexed data."
