        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "1 is the output of the above code as indexing in R starts from 1. The output can be viewed in the R console. R studio has both R terminal and the R console. Each output format is implemented as a function in R. You can customize the output by passing arguments to the function as sub-values of the output field."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "\u201c:\u201d operator is used to create an integer sequence. The other operators are used for other purposes. Integer sequence is the basic operator used in R. The [ operator can be used to extract multiple elements of a vector by passing the operator an integer sequence."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "A vector can only contain objects of the same class. A vector cannot have contain objects of the different class. Same class objects are used mostly. The most basic type of R object is a vector. Empty vectors can be created with the vector() function."

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "NaN is used to define the \u201cundefined\u201d value in the R language. Undefined values also have some value in R. Missing values are denoted by NA or NaN for q undefined mathematical operations. A NaN value is also NA but the converse is not true."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "NaN is called Not a Number. It is the full form of NaN. Full forms can be viewed in R studio by typing help. A NaN value is also NA but the converse is not true. The value NaN represents an undefined value."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Inf is used to define \u201cInfinity\u201d in R. It is somewhat different from other programming languages. There is also a special number of Inf which represents infinity."

        "options": [],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "Here TRUE is taken as 1. Then it will give output as 1 and 2. FALSE can be taken as 0. T and F are short-hand ways to specify TRUE and FALSE."

        "question": "What is the class defined by the following R code?",
        "options": [],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Here 2 is changed into character. Since the y belongs to list. A list contains only characters. Combining a numeric object with a character object will create a character vector because numbers can usually be easily represented as strings."
