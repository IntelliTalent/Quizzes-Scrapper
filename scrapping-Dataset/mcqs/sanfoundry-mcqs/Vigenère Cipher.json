        "answer": "Answer:d",
        "explanation": "In poly alphabetic cipher each symbol of plain text is replaced by a different cipher text regardless of its occurrence. Out of the given options only multiplicative cipher is not a poly alphabetic cipher."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Keyword cipher is less secure than vigenere cipher. It is due to the fact that keyword cipher is mono alphabetic and thus can be cracked using frequency analysis. But vigenere cipher being a poly alphabetic cipher cannot be deciphered using this method."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "In transposition cipher and mono alphabetic cipher the number of letters remain same in ciphered and deciphered text. But in poly alphabetic cipher the number of letters are different. So here as vigenere cipher is the only poly alphabetic cipher so it will be the answer."
