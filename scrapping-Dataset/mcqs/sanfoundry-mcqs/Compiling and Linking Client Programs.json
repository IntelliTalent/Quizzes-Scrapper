            "c) -lp",
            "d) -lq"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "To compile a program written in the C language, it is compiled by issuing the option \u2018-lm\u2019. The examples of some math functions found in \u2018math.h\u2019 are floor(), sqrt(), pow(), log()."

            "d) -b"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "When a C program is compiled with gcc, the option -o is issued in order to specify the name of the executable that is created after compilation. The default name given is \u2018a.out\u2019."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The Makefile is used to write multiple commands in there. The file is executed by prefixing the command \u2018make\u2019 with the command to run the file script containing the statements."

        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The \u2018-I\u2019 option is specified when the client programs are compiled that use the MySQL header files. The compiler can easily find these header files when the \u2018-I\u2019 option is used."

            "d) -vmysqlclient"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "MySQL clients should be linked using the \u2018-lmysqlclient\u2019 option in the link command. A \u2018-L\u2019 option also needs to be specified to tell the linker where to find the library for it."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "On Unix, the linking process uses the dynamic libraries by default. In order to link to the static client library instead, its path name should be added to the link command to do the job."

        "options": [],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "A clearly significant difference between Perl and PHP is that Perl has a bigger memory footprint than PHP. Apache processes are larger with \u2018mod_perl\u2019 linked in than with \u2018mod_php\u2019."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The code can be linked with either the dynamic or static C client library. On Windows, the static library is named \u2018mysqlclient.lib\u2019 and the dynamic library is named \u2018libmysql.dll\u2019."
