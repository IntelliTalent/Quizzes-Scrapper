        "options": [
            "a) Sum of residuals (\u2211(Y \u2013 h(X))) is minimum",
            "b) Sum of the absolute value of residuals (\u2211|Y-h(X)|) is maximum",
            "c) Sum of the square of residuals ( \u2211 (Y-h(X))2) is minimum",
            "d) Sum of the square of residuals ( \u2211 (Y-h(X))2) is maximum"
        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Here we penalize higher error value much more as compared to the smaller one, such that there is a significant difference between making big errors and small errors, which makes it easy to differentiate and select the best fit line."

        "options": [
            "a) Test error is also always zero",
            "b) Test error is non zero",

            "d) Test error is equal to Train error"
        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Test Error depends on the test data. If the Test data is an exact representation of train data then test error is always zero. But this may not be the case."

        "question": "Which of the following metrics can be used for evaluating regression models?",
        "options": [],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "These (R Squared, Adjusted R Squared, F Statistics, RMSE / MSE / MAE) are some metrics which you can use to evaluate your regression model."

        "explanation": "lm(formula, data) refers to a linear model in which formula is the object of the class \u201cformula\u201d, representing the relation between variables. Now this formula is on applied on the data to create a relationship model."

        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Formula is just a symbol to show the relationship and is applied on data which is a vector. In General, data.frame are used for data."
