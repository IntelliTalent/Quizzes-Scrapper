        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "MySQL is a \u2018relational\u2019 DBMS. It is efficient at relating data in two different tables and joining information from them. Hierarchical and Network DBMS are based on parent-child relationships of records. Object-oriented DBMS use objects to represent models."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Since MySQL is an RDBMS, it\u2019s data is organised in tables for establishing relationships. A table is a collection of rows and columns, where each row is a record and columns describe the feature of records."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Each column in a table represents a feature (attribute) of a record. Table stores the information for an entity whereas a row represents a record. Object has no relevance in an RDBMS."
