        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Given above was a basic syntax of the SELECT statement. Everything in the syntax is optional except the \u2018select_list\u2019 option. All the others are free to be omitted, and will work fine."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The inner join is a form of join in MySQL that is used to combine the result of concatenating the contents of two tables into a new table. In inner join, result is produced by matching rows in one table with rows in another table."

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "In \u2018cartesian product\u2019, each row of each table is combined with each row in every other table to produce all possible combination. This produces a very large number of rows since the number is the product of rows."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "The \u2018inner join\u2019 only deals with rows where a match can be found in both tables. The \u2018LEFT JOIN\u2019 and \u2018RIGHT JOIN\u2019 types are \u2018OUTER JOIN\u2019 types which differ from inner joins in this sense."

        "explanation": "Joining a table to itself in a database is called \u2018self-join\u2019. When a self-join is being performed, the table is being used multiple times within the query and a table name qualifier is unnecessary."
