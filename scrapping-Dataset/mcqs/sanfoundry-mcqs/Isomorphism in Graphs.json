        "explanation": "A graph can exist in different forms having the same number of vertices, edges and also the same edge connectivity, such graphs are called isomorphic graphs. Two graphs G1 and G2 are said to be isomorphic if \u2212> 1) their number of components (vertices and edges) are same and 2) their edge connectivity is retained. Isomorphic graphs must have adjacency matrix representation."

        "explanation": "If G is a planar graph with n vertices and m edges then r(G) = 2m i.e. the grade or rank of G is equal to the twofold of the number of edges in G. So, the rank of the graph is 2*15=30 having 8 vertices and 15 edges."
