            "d) 56549"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "There are 3 sisters and 8 other girls in total of 11 girls. The number of ways to arrange these 11 girls in a circular manner = (11\u2013 1)! = 10!. These three sisters can now rearrange themselves in 3! ways. By the multiplication theorem, the number of ways so that 3 sisters always come together in the arrangement = 8! \u00d7 3!. Hence, the required number of ways in which the arrangement can take place if none of the 3 sisters is seated together: 10! \u2013 (8! \u00d7 3!) = 3628800 \u2013 (40320 * 6) = 3628800 \u2013 241920 = 3386880."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "There are six places to be filled in the multiset using the n distinct elements. At least one element has to occur exactly twice and that would leave 4 more places in the multiset means that at most four elements can occur exactly once. Thus there are two mutually exclusive cases as follows: 1) Exactly one element occurs exactly twice and select this element in n ways. Fill up the remaining four spots using 5 distinct elements from the remaining n\u22121 elements in"
