        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "A graph can have many spanning trees. Each spanning tree of a graph G is a subgraph of the graph G, and spanning trees include every vertex of the gram. Spanning trees are always acyclic."

        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree with the lowest cost among all the spacing trees. Sum of all of the edges in the spanning tree is the cost of the spanning tree. There can be many minimum spanning trees for a given graph."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Here all non-diagonal elements in the adjacency matrix are 1. So, every vertex is connected every other vertex of the graph. And, so graph M has 3 distinct minimum spanning trees."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Every MST will contain CD as it is smallest edge. So, Every minimum spanning tree of G must contain CD is true. And G has a unique minimum spanning tree is also true because the graph has edges with distinct weights. So, no minimum spanning tree contains AB is false."
