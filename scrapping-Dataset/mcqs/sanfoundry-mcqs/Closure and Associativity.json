        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "As it is an intersection so the order must divide both K and L. Here 3, 6, 30 does not divide 14. But 5 must be the order of the group as it divides the order of intersection of K and L as well as the order of the group."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Closure for all a, b\u2208G, the result of the operation, a+b, is also in G. Since there is one element, hence a=b=0, and a+b=0+0=0\u2208G. Hence, closure property is satisfied. Associative for all a, b, c\u2208G, (a+b)+c=a+(b+c). For example, a=b=c=0. Hence (a+b)+c=a+(b+c)"

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "We need to find the number of co-primes of 73 which are less than 73. As 73 itself is a prime, all the numbers less than that are co-prime to it and it makes a group of order 72 then it can be of {1, 3, 5, 7, 11\u2026.}."
