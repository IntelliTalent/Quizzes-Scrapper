            "a) True",
            "b) False"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The elementary operation of PHP is interpreting a script in order to produce a web page. This is sent to a client. A PHP script generally contains a mix of HTML and executable code."

        "question": "The PHP interpreter switches mode continuously.",
        "options": [
            "a) True",
            "b) False"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "As soon as the PHP interpreter comes across a special opening tag it switches from \u2018text copy\u2019 mode to \u2018PHP code\u2019 mode. It starts interpreting the file as PHP code to be executed."

            "c) not generated",
            "d) no output"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The interpreter switches between code mode back and text mode when it sees another special tag which signals the end of the code. This enables the mix of static text with dynamically generated results."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "All the PHP scripts that use variables have variable names preceded by the dollar sign (\u2018$\u2019). The variables are signified by this identifier, irrespective of the value it stores."

            "d) DECIMAL"
        ],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "Currency is a numeric information. For monetary calculations, FLOAT and DOUBLE are subject to rounding error and may not be suitable. A DECIMAL(M, 2) type is best suited for it."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Stored functions return a result from a calculation and can be used in expressions. Stored procedures do not return a result directly but can be used to perform general computations."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "In MySQL, triggers are associated with a table. They are defined to execute when the table is modified via INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE statements. MySQL supports objects to be stored on server side."

            "d) CREATE PROCEDURE"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The \u2018CREATE FUNCTION\u2019 statement is used to create a stored function in MySQL. The \u2018CREATE PROCEDURE\u2019 statement is used to create a stored procedure instead, from which values are not returned."

        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "In MySQL, the stored function cannot return multiple values. Instead, multiple stored functions can be written and invoked from within a single statement however, they are different from stored procedures."
