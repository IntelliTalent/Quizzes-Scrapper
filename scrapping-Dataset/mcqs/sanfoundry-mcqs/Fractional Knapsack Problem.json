        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Fractional knapsack problem is also called continuous knapsack problem. Fractional knapsack is solved using dynamic programming."

        "question": "Fractional knapsack problem is solved most efficiently by which of the following algorithm?",

            "c) Greedy algorithm",
            "d) Backtracking"
        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Greedy algorithm is used to solve this problem. We first sort items according to their value/weight ratio and then add item with highest ratio until we cannot add the next item as a whole. At the end, we add the next item as much as we can."

        "question": "What is the objective of the knapsack problem?",
        "options": [
            "a) To get maximum total value in the knapsack",

            "d) To get minimum weight in the knapsack"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The objective is to fill the knapsack of some given volume with different materials such that the value of selected items is maximized."

        "question": "Which of the following statement about 0/1 knapsack and fractional knapsack problem is correct?",
        "options": [
            "a) In 0/1 knapsack problem items are divisible and in fractional knapsack items are indivisible",
            "b) Both are the same",
            "c) 0/1 knapsack is solved using a greedy algorithm and fractional knapsack is solved using dynamic programming",
            "d) In 0/1 knapsack problem items are indivisible and in fractional knapsack items are divisible"
        ],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "In fractional knapsack problem we can partially include an item into the knapsack whereas in 0/1 knapsack we have to either include or exclude the item wholly."

        "question": "Time complexity of fractional knapsack problem is ____________",

            "d) O(nW)"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "As the main time taking a step is of sorting so it defines the time complexity of our code. So the time complexity will be O(n log n) if we use quick sort for sorting."

            "d) 40"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The value/weight ratio are-{2,3,4}. So we include the second and third items wholly into the knapsack. This leaves only 5 units of volume for the first item. So we include the first item partially."
    },
    {
        "question": "The result of the fractional knapsack is greater than or equal to 0/1 knapsack.",

            "b) False"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "As fractional knapsack gives extra liberty to include the object partially which is not possible with 0/1 knapsack, thus we get better results with a fractional knapsack."
