        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "For InnoDB tables it is possible to perform an online backup that takes no locks on tables using the option \u2018\u2013single-transaction\u2019 to \u2018mysqldump\u2019. The \u2018mysqldump\u2019 can make backups."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "A way to create text data files along with files containing \u2018CREATE TABLE\u2019 statements for the backed up tables is to use \u2018mysqldump\u2019 with \u2013tab. To reload a delimited text data file \u2018mysqlimport\u2019 is used."

            "b) False"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Replication enables data from one MySQL database server (the master) to be copied to one or more MySQL database servers (the slaves). Replication is asynchronous by default."

        "explanation": "Both of the client library routines named \u2018mysql_init()\u2019 and \u2018mysql_real_connect()\u2019 return a pointer to the connection handler in order to indicate success and NULL to indicate failure."

        "options": [],
        "answer": "b",

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The general statement-issuing routine is mysql_real_query(). The statement is provided as a counted string (a string plus a length). The length of the statement string must be kept track of."
