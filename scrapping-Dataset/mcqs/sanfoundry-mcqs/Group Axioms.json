        "explanation": " \u2018\u2217\u2019 can be de\ufb01ned by the formula a\u2217b = a for any a and b in S. Hence, (a \u2217 b)\u2217c = a\u2217c = a and a \u2217(b \u2217 c)= a \u2217 b = a. Therefore, \u201d\u2217\u201d is associative. Hence (S, \u2217) is a semigroup. On the contrary, * is not associative since, for example, (b\u2022c)\u2022c = a\u2022c = c but b\u2022(c\u2022c) = b\u2022a = b Thus (S,\u2022) is not a semigroup."
