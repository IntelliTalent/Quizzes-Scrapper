        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Power set of a set is defined as the set of all subsets. Ex- S={1,2} then P={{},{1},{2}{1,2}}."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "For finding the number of elements in the power set of the given set we need to remove duplicates. So we will be left with 6 unique elements which will be P={{},{1},{2},{1,2},{2,2},{1,2,2}}."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "In the correct version we are taking two cases for each element. In the first case the element is included in the subset and in the second case it is not included. So in this manner, we find all the subsets of the given set."

        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "In case when duplicates are present in the set then the number of elements in the power set decreases. It is because we remove subsets with identical elements."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "In the correct version of the code we are fixing a prefix and generate all corresponding subsets. Then after all subsets with a prefix are generated, we replace last character with one of the remaining character."
