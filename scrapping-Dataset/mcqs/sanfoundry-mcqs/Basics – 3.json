            "a) Character string",
            "b) String",
            "c) Data strings",
            "d) Raw data"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Single element of a character vector is often referred to as a character string. Dates are represented by the Date class and can be coerced from a character string using the as.Date() function. This is a common way to end up with a Date object in R."

            "d) .c"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "All R files have an extension .R.  R provides a mechanism for recalling and re-executing previous commands. All S programmed files will have an extension .S. But R has many functions than S."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "C, C++ and Fortran can be linked. There are a number of people had used something like C/C++ programming languages to manipulate the R objects."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "TIBCO is the current owner of the S language. In 2008, Insightful was acquired by TIBCO for $25 million. As of this writing, TIBCO is the current owner of the S language and is its exclusive developer."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "CRAN hosts many add-on packages that can extend the functionality of R. Connections allow R functions to talk to all different external objects without having to write custom code for each object."

        "question": "Dataframes can be converted into a matrix by calling the following function data ______",
        "options": [
            "a) matr()",

            "c) matrixf()",
            "d) matrixfunc()"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "as.matrix function should be used to coerce a data frame to a matrix. It might seem that the as.matrix() function should be used to coerce a data frame to a matrix."

        "question": "What will be the output of the following R code?",
        "options": [],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "It is not possible to coerce, so you will get a Warning. Logical creates a logical vector of the specified length. Each element of the vector is equal to FALSE. as.logical attempts to coerce its argument to be of a logical type."

        "question": "What will be the output of the following R code?",
        "options": [],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Mode of the given command is a character. There are a complementary function writeLines() that takes a character vector and writes each element of the vector one line at a time to a text file."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Calls, expressions and names are the three types of objects that constitute the R language. There is really only one rule about vectors in R, which is that A vector can only contain objects of the same class. R objects can have names, which is very useful for writing readable code and self-describing objects."
