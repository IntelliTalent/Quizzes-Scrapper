        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "In a connected graph, a bridge is an edge whose removal disconnects the graph. In a cycle if we remove an edge, it will still be connected. So, bridge cannot be part of a cycle. A clique is any complete subgraph of a graph."

        ],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "In any simple undirected graph, total degree of all vertices is even (since each edge contributes 2 degrees). So number of vertices having odd degrees must be even, otherwise, their sum would have been odd, making total degree also odd. Now single vertex n is connected to all these even number of vertices (which have odd degrees). So, degree of n is also even. Moreover, now degree of all vertices which are connected to v is increased by 1, hence earlier vertices which had odd degree now have even degree. So now, all vertices in the graph have even degree, which is necessary and sufficient condition for euler graph."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Edge set consists of edges from i to j using either 1) j = i+1 OR 2) j=3i. The trick to solving this question is to think in a reverse way. Instead of finding a path from 1 to 50, try to find a path from 100 to 1. The edge sequence with the minimum number of edges is 1 \u2013 3 \u2013 9 \u2013 10 \u2013 11 \u2013 33 which consists of 6 edges."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "In a graph of n vertices we can draw an edge from a vertex to n-1 vertex we will do it for n vertices and so total number of edges is n*(n-1). Now each edge is counted twice so the required maximum number of edges is n*(n-1)/2. Hence, 8*(8-1)/2 = 28 edges."
