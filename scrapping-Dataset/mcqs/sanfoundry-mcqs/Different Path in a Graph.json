        "answer": "a",

        "explanation": "The Eulerian path in a graph say, G is a walk from one vertex to another, that can pass through all vertices of G as well as traverses exactly once every edge of G. Therefore, an Eulerian path can not be a circuit. A Hamiltonian path is a walk that contains every vertex of the graph exactly once. Hence, a Hamiltonian path is not a circuit."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "The shortest path will change in the modified graph. Suppose that the shortest path is of weight 21 and has 7 edges and there is another path with 4 edges and total weight 17. Now, the weight of the first shortest path is increased by 7*10 and becomes 21 + 70 and the weight of the second path is increased by 4*10 and becomes 17 + 40. So the shortest path changes to the other path with weight as 57."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "In BFS due to the least number of edges between two vertices and so if all the edges in a graph are of same weight, then to find the shortest path BFS can be used for efficiency. So we have to split all edges of weight 5 into two edges of weight 2 each and one edge of weight 1. In the worst case, all edges are of weight 1. To split all edges, O(E) operations can be done and so the time complexity becomes which is equal to O(V+E)."
