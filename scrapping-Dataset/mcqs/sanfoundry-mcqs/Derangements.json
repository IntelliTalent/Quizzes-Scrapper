        ],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "The place of 2, 4, 6 is specified i.e. each of them will get their place out of the last 3 places only. So 1, 3, 5 will automatically get one of the places in the first 3 places. This must ensure that 2, 4 and 6 occupies one of the last 3 places each and 1, 3 and 5 one of 1st 3 places each. Hence, 1, 3 and 5 can be arranged in 3! ways and 2, 4 and 6 also in 3! Ways. So, no of such derangements = 3! * 3! = 6 * 6 = 36."
