        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "An undirected graph G which is connected and acyclic is termed as a tree. G contains no cycles and if any edge is added to G a simple cycle is formed."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Suppose G is a connected graph which has no cycles. Every subgraph of G includes at least one vertex with zero or one incident edges. It has n vertices and n-1 edges. Generally, the order-zero graph is not considered to be a tree."

            "d) A tree which contains n vertices and n-1 cycles"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "A star tree of order n is a tree with as many leaves as possible or in other words a star tree is a tree that consists of a single internal vertex and n-1 leaves. However, an internal vertex is a vertex of degree at least 2."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "A directed acyclic graph is known as a polytree whose underlying undirected graph is a tree. In other words, a directed tree is a directed graph which would be tree if the directions on the edges were ignored."

        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Every tree element is called a node and the lines connecting the elements are called branches. A finite tree structure has a member that has no superior and is called the \u201croot\u201d Or root node. Nodes that have no child are called leaf nodes."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "A linear graph also known as a path graph is a graph which consists of k vertices arranged in a line, so that vertices from i and i+1 are connected by an edge for i=0,\u2026, k-1."

        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "A forest is an undirected acyclic graph in which all the connected components are individual trees. This graph contains a disjoint union of trees."
