            "a) it helps in encryption",
            "b) it strengthens the cipher",

            "d) it makes encryption easy"
        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "The purpose of having an indicator block in running key cipher is to give information to the receiver about the source of a key being used. It is usually included in the second last block of the message."

        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Running key cipher is a substitution cipher. It falls under the category of poly alphabetic cipher as it uses multiple substitutions at different positions in order to cipher the plain text."

        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Running key cipher is a poly alphabetic cipher. It uses a key book or key text instead of a keyword which is agreed by both parties before encryption takes place."

            "d) vigenere cipher was used in ancient time whereas running key cipher is used in modern world"
        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "In running key cipher key is not repeated unlike vigenere cipher. They both use the same table for encryption."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Encryption of plain text using running key cipher is done by making use of tabula recta. It consists of 26 rows and 26 columns which have alphabets written 26 times. These are shifted towards left after each row."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Keyword cipher is less secure than running key cipher. It is due to the fact that keyword cipher is mono alphabetic and thus can be cracked using frequency analysis. But running key cipher being a poly alphabetic cipher is harder to crack."
