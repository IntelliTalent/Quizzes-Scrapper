Thus, n3 could be 1, 4, 7, 10, 13,\u2026 and n3 needs to divide 219/3=73. Hence the only possible value for n3 is n3=1. So there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P3 of G. By Sylow\u2019s theorem, the unique Sylow 3-subgroup must be a normal subgroup of G. Similarly, n73=1, 74,\u2026 and n73 must divide 219/73=3 and hence we must have n73=1.

Let P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G. The subgroup P is normal in G as it is the unique 5-Sylow subgroup. Then consider the subnormal series G\u25b9P\u25b9{e}, where e is the identity element of G. Then the factor groups G/P, P/{e} have order 4 and 5 respectively. Hence these are cyclic groups(in particular abelian). Hence, the group G of order 20 has a subnormal series whose factor groups are abelian groups, and thus G is a solvable group."
