        "options": [],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The above dynamic programming algorithm uses space equal to the length of the array to store the sum values. So, the space complexity is O(n)."

        "options": [],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The current sum (i.e. sum[idx]) uses the previous sum (i.e. sum[idx \u2013 1]) to get an optimal value. So, line 4 shows the optimal substructure property."

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "The array \u201csum\u201d is used to store the previously calculated values, so that they aren\u2019t recalculated. So, line 4 uses the memoization technique."
