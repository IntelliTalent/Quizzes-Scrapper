        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "YACC technique is a computer code for the Unix operating system. It is a LALR parser generator, generating a parser, the part of a compiler that tries to make syntactic sense of the source code."

            "d) None of the mentioned"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The YACC takes C code as input and produces shift reduce parsers in C,also known as Bottom up parsers which execute C snippets with the associated rule."

            "a) BNF means Backus Naur Form",
            "b) It is a normal form used in Data base normalization",
            "c) It is a notation technique for context free grammar",
            "d) None of the mentioned"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The normal form used in Data base normalization is BCNF i.e. Boyce Codd normal form and NOT Backus Naur Form."

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "W grammar or van Wijngaarden form is used to define potentially infinite context free grammars in a finite number of rules. It is an example of larger class of affix grammars. This technique was used to define the P/L Algol 68."
