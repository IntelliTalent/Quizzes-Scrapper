        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "A graph coloring is an assignment of labels to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same labels is called the colors of the graph. Now, the chromatic number of any graph is the minimal number of colors for which such an assignment is possible."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The chromatic number of a graph is the minimal number of colors for which a graph coloring is possible. A graph G is termed as k-colorable if there exists a graph coloring on G with k colors. If a graph is k-colorable, then it is n-colorable for any n>k."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The density of a planar graph or network is described as the ratio of the number of edges(E) to the number of possible edges in a network with(N) nodes. So,  D = E \u2212 N + 1/ 2 N \u2212 5. Hence, the required answer is: D=(34-13+1)/(2*13-5) = 22/21. A completely sparse planar graph has density 0 and a completely dense planar graph has degree 1."

            "d) n>=(6/5)(n+1)"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Because G is connected and planar, Euler\u2019s theorem is bound to be involved. Let f denote the number of faces so that n\u2212m+f=2. Because the length of the smallest cycle in G is 5, every face has at least 5 edges adjacent to it. This means 2m\u22655f because every edge is adjacent to two faces. Plugging this in yields 2=n\u2212m+f\u2264n\u2212m+2/5m=n\u22123/5m, and hence m\u22645/3(n\u22122)."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The plane graph with an edge at most 6+2(m\u22123) is the greatest planar graph. So, in this case the number of edges is 6."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "A non-planar graph can have removed edges and vertices so that it contains subgraphs. However, non-planar graphs cannot be drawn in a plane and so no edge of the graph can cross it."
