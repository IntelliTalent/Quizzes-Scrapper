        ],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "In transposition cipher, the letters remain the same in ciphered and plain text. Their position is only changed whereas in substitution cipher the letters become different in encrypted text. As additive cipher is the only non transposition cipher out of the given options so it will be the correct option."

        ],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "For encrypting using columnar cipher we have to arrange the letters of the plain text in a table which has the same number of columns as the letters of the keyword. Then the letters of the keyword are arranged in alphabetical order and we read along each column."

        "explanation": "The number of columns in the table used for the purpose encryption in columnar transposition cipher will always be equal to the number of letters in the keyword.So when we will write the letters of the plain text row wise then there will be 2 rows of plain text in this case.
