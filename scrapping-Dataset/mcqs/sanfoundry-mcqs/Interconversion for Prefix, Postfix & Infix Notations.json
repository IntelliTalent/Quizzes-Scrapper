        "options": [
            "a) two queues",

            "d) one stack"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "In the infix expression, the operator appears between the operands and in infix notation if the operator appears before the operands in the expression. For the conversion between them two stacks are used efficiently. The idea is to use one stack for operators and other to store operands."

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "In a postfix expression, the operators appear after the operands. Conversion from prefix to postfix is done directly which is better than converting the prefix expression in infix and then infix to postfix expression. It gives better efficiency."
