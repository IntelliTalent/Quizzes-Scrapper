            "d) 260"
        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "A Hamiltonian cycle in a connected graph G is defined as a closed path that traverses every vertex of G exactly once except the starting vertex, at which the path also terminates. In an n-complete graph, there are (n-1)!/2 hamiltonian cycles and so the answer is 360."

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "A vertex colouring of a graph G = (V\u2019,E\u2019) with m colours is a mapping f:V\u2019 -> {1,\u2026,m}  such that f(u)!=f(v) for every (u,v) belongs to E\u2019. Since in worst case the graph can be complete, d+1 colours are necessary for graph containing vertices with degree at most \u2018d\u2019. So, the required answer is 24."

            "d) 17/53"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Here we are given a forest with 54 vertices and 17 components. A  component is itself a tree and since there are 17 components means that every component has a root, therefore we have 17 roots. Each new vertex of the forest contributes to a single edge to a forest. So for remaining 54-17 = 37 vertices we can have m-n=37 edges. Hence, answer is 37."

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "In a complete graph which is (n-1) regular (where n is the number of vertices) has edges n*(n-1)/2. In the graph n vertices are adjacent to n-1 vertices and an edge contributes two degree so dividing by 2. Hence, in a d regular graph number of edges will be n*d/2 = 46*8/2 = 184."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "For the given condition we can simply design a K-Map and mark an edge between every two adjacent cells in K-map. Hence, that will give us a Bipartite graph and chromatic number for this = 2. Hence the ratio is 2/n=2/100=1/50 and the given graph is actually a hypercube graph."
