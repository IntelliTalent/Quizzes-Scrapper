        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The coin change problem has overlapping subproblems(same subproblems are solved multiple times) and optimal substructure(the solution to the problem can be found by finding optimal solutions for subproblems). So, dynamic programming can be used to solve the coin change problem."
