        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "MySQL provides statements to change the structure of tables. To add or remove the indexes on the existing database tables, the \u2018CREATE INDEX\u2019 and \u2018DROP INDEX\u2019 tables are used."

        "explanation": "Every time a table is created in MySQL, it creates a disk file containing the format of the table. It has two components, namely, base name (here, \u2018my_tbl\u2019) and an extension (here, \u2018frm\u2019)."
