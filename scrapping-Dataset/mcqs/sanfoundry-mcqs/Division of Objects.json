        "explanation": "To solve the problem first find the prime factorization of each term of the product, and place the factors of each term into a box. Then, since N is the product of distinct prime factors, each prime factor appears in a unique box. Since the product of all of these terms is N, each prime factor must be in a box. Conversely, for any arrangement of these n distinct primes into r identical boxes, multiply the primes in a box to create a term and the product of these terms results in N. This establishes the bijection and the number of ways is B"
