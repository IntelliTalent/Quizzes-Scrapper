        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Polybius square is similar to substitution cipher. Polybius square allows us to cipher the plain text in such a way that a minimum number of symbols are used in the encrypted text."

        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Polybius square is closely related to mono alphabetic substitution cipher and thus is more vulnerable to frequency analysis. Whereas polybius square being a poly alphabetic cipher is less vulnerable to frequency analysis and so is more secure."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "For decoding ciphered text we have to use the polybius square in and find out the letters corresponding to each pair of coordinate. So in this case the plain text is found to be \u201cCSK\u201d."
