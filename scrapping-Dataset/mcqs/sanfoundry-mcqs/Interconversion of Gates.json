            "a) NOR gate",
            "b) NAND gate",
            "c) X-NOR gate",
            "d) XOR gate"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The NAND gate consists of two inputs and if both of them are high the output is low. A luggage security alarm circuit is a system which is based on the NAND gate. It is used to generate an alarm when any authorized person tries to steal the luggage."

            "d) 4 and 8"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The data, in boolean algebra must be in a bit-representation form which can be in between two values 0 and 1."

            "d) flip-flop"
        ],
        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "A shift register, in digital circuitry, is a combination of two or more flip-flops to share the bits of information by using the same clock. A shift register can have both parallel and serial inputs and outputs."

            "d) 8"
        ],
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "An XOR gate is created by using four NAND gates. This construction gives a propagation delay three times to that of a single NAND gate."

            "d) raising bit, sinking bit"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "In multiplexer gate for selecting the inputs say, for 3 input bits, one bit is required as selector bit and two other bits are required as data bits."

            "d) OR gate"
        ],
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "NOT gate is the simplest digital logic circuit which is also called an inverter because it takes the input in 0 or 1 form and gives the output as the complement of the input."

            "d) 1387"
        ],
        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "OR gate works in a way such that if any of the input is binary low(or 0), the output of the gate is binary 1(or high). Here, the number of stage possible = 2"
